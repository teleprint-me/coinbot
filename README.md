## About CoinBot

CoinBot is a project aimed at providing automated trading with a compound
interest strategy.

## Usage

### Simulation

The `simulate.py` script is designed to work with a single trade pair and blocks
if more than one trade pair is given, you can use the following commands to test
different scenarios:

1. **Basic Usage with Default Values**: This command will run the script with
   default values for the trade pair, timeframe, and other options.

   ```sh
   python -m coinbot.sample
   ```

2. **Specify Trade Pair and Timeframe**: You can specify the trade pair (crypto
   symbols) and the timeframe for sampling. For example:

   ```sh
   python -m coinbot.sample --symbols ETH/USD --timeframe 1H
   ```

3. **Specify Start and End Dates**: You can provide specific start and end dates
   for sampling. For example:

   ```sh
   python -m coinbot.sample --start 2023-01-01 --end 2023-08-31
   ```

4. **Customize Principal and Rate**: You can adjust the principal amount and
   annual interest rate. For example:

   ```sh
   python -m coinbot.sample --principal 500.00 --rate 0.15
   ```

5. **Change Frequency and Interval**: You can modify the compounding frequency
   and time step interval. For example:

   ```sh
   python -m coinbot.sample --frequency 250 --interval 2
   ```

6. **Testing Error Handling**: You can test how the script handles errors by
   providing an invalid trade pair or missing required options:

   ```sh
   python -m coinbot.sample --symbols INVALIDPAIR
   python -m coinbot.sample --symbols BTC/USD --interval -1
   ```

7. **Example with All Options**: A more comprehensive command using various
   options:

   ```sh
   python -m coinbot.sample --symbols LTC/USD --timeframe 15T --start 2023-07-01 --end 2023-07-15 --principal 1000.00 --rate 0.08 --frequency 180 --interval 3
   ```

Keep in mind that the script is designed for a single trade pair, so you can
experiment with different options to see how the script behaves under various
scenarios. Make sure to provide valid options to avoid triggering error
handling.
