Amount and periodically purchasing an asset at that amount based on a
predetermined Frequency. This approach aims to spread investment over time,
reducing the impact of market fluctuations.

The columns for our data table are: Datetime, Market Price, Current Target,
Current Value, Order Size, Total Order Size, and Interval. This structure keeps
the tabulation of our data simple and compact.
